Advanced machine learning examines the application of neural networks in the context of
option pricing valuation.Different parameters are tested and compared in order to achieve
better performance and higher accuracy in option valuation.If we talk about neural
networks different layers are used in better training of the model.We already calculated
option for Black-Schholes formula.Benchmark for the deep learning will be how we use
the size and number of hidden layers in the neural network to calculate option prices from
deep learning.
